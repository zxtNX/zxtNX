# Who is this random guy?!
Uh. Don't say that! 
"Hello world", I'm an aspiring malware/vulnerability hunter with a strong passion for security and internals. Currently honing my skills by developing and analyzing softwares to understand potential vulnerabilities and devise robust defenses by exploring, digging and simulating various exploit methods while learning internals.

Eager to enhance, create, and harden systems that will help us get an edge from threats and APTs.
