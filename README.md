# Who is this random guy?!
Uh. Don't say that! 
"Hello world", I'm an aspiring Anti-Cheat Engineer with a strong passion for game security and internals. Currently honing my skills by developing and analyzing cheats to understand potential vulnerabilities and devise robust defenses.

By exploring, digging and simulating various cheating methods while learning internals, I aim without a bot (did you get this one? ;) ;) ;) funny?...) to create secure and enjoyable gaming environments.

Eager to enhance, create, and harden systems that will help us get rid of cheaters.
